# webDevBootCamp

Exercises, code-alongs and projects from [*The Web Developer Bootcamp*](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/).

Work in progress. 

Anything to do with cats or dogs has been replaced with *Meles Meles*, the superior small mammal. 

[See here for the official source code associated with the course](https://github.com/nax3t/webdevbootcamp) 

Contents
 * Exercises and code-alongs from the various sections (numbered as on Udemy). Most of the js introduction is absent since I already had the basics.
 * `YelpCamp` full stack (MEN - Mongoose, express, node) project. A "yelp" for campgrounds (some small features still to add when have time, but core functionality of routes, database, and most UI elements implemented)
 * `mongoDBAtlas` how to hook up to the cloud service for mongoDB instead of using the local database like Colt does in his videos. This is then used in the other projects. Amounts to a bit more boilerplate.
