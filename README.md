# webDevBootCamp

Exercises, code-alongs and projects from [*The Web Developer Bootcamp*](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/).

I did most of it, except for the basic javascript introduction (Section 10-14), which I only skimmed and didn't do the exercises since I am already familiar with it.
